## Preparation

1. Set up tiles according to players amount.
2. Add ancient buildings unless there are 4 players. If solo or 2 players, tiles are marked.
If 3 players, the tiles are unmarked, you need to add one on Lands of Yomi (where you acquire spirits and fireflies),
and one on Glade of Jade (where you acquire resources).
3. Place Kodama Tiles. In case of expansions use at least a basic kodama tile,
never more of 2 of each type, and use 1/3/5 and 2/4/6 for basic tiles.
2 basic and 1 of each other works for starters.
If two players, add a third kodama on the selected place.
4. Setup piles and restock shops
5. Give each player a random Iwakura Rock (Put it at the leftmost space available)
6. Give each player starting Yokai
7. Give each player one random Firefly
8. Give each player one random Vision
9. Give each player an amulet (1)
10. Give each player a wood and a jade
