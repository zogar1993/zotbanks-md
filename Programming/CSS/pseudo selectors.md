## Pseudo Classes

These use ":", and refer to things as *:hover* or *:focus*.

## Pseudo Elements

These use "::", and refer to things as *::before* or *::after*.
They can work with ":" instead, but thats only because of retro-compatibility.

### ::before and ::after

These are placed before or after the content of an element, not the element itself.

This is why these pseudo elements do not work with self closing elements, like image, input or br.
