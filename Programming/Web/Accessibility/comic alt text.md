## Structure of a Panel

1. List how many panels
2. Clarify which image you are describing
3. Explain the visual elements of your image.
    - Only use tangible descriptors.
    - If there are multiple characters, make sure to label which one you are referring to.
    - Don't go overboard describing everything. Pick and choose which best tells your story.
4. Write the caption or spoken text in the image.
    - Punctuation and symbols are not always screen reader friendly. Be mindful how you use any.
    - If you intentionally misspell something, write it so that it can be readable in the alt caption and specify it was written originally in a particular fashion or tone.

### Considerations
- It’s not necessary to mention that it’s a comic if that would already be apparent from context.
- Introduce the characters.
- Share the dialog.
- Describe what the characters are doing.
- It’s not necessary to describe recurring characters in every post.
- Small details often turn out to be important later on, so she tries to describe everything that’s new or relevant.
- In addition to what the characters are doing or saying, she might describe body language or an overall tone or mood of the panel, which could be conveyed by a change in the background color.
- Providing a high level of detail in her descriptions may reveal things that many sighted readers might overlook, rendering a somewhat different experience.
- There is a danger of the descriptions becoming too clinical and losing the mood of the comic.
- Since the text description is provided by a reader, not the author, the writer’s uncertainty about what she is seeing and what might be important is clear.
- When describing colors, use shade names such as cobalt blue, periwinkle, burgundy, lime green, metallic gold, or similar names- there’s no need to describe what the color red looks like, but shade names are helpful for providing more in-depth information. However, there’s no need to give shade names for every color in an image if color is not the main focus.
- Avoid sharing personal opinions about what an image looks like, such as if a dog looks cute or if a dress looks ugly
- Do not include emoji or excessive punctuation in alt text, unless it is part of a text transcript. Some creators will write “twenty-five exclamation points” or “five cake emoji” because excessive punctuation and emoji are read one at a time by a screen reader.
