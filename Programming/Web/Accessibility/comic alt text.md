## Writing alt text

1. List how many panels
2. Clarify which image you are describing
3. Explain the visual elements of your image.
    - Only use tangible descriptors.
    - If there are multiple characters, make sure to label which one you are referring to.
    - Don't go overboard describing everything. Pick and choose which best tells your story.
4. Write the caption or spoken text in the image.
    - Punctuation and symbols are not always screen reader friendly. Be mindful how you use any.
    - If you intentionally misspell something, write it so that it can be readable in the alt caption and specify it was written originally in a particular fashion or tone.
