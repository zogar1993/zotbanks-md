## Types of dropdown

- Menu: A list of commands or actions that the user can perform within the page content.
- Navigation: A list of links used for navigating through a website.
- Select: A form control (```<select>```) that displays a list of options for the user to select within a form.

## Select requirements 
- There is a button that contains the current selected option.
- Clicking the box toggles the visibility of the options list (also called listbox).
- Clicking an option in the listbox updates the selected value. The button text changes and the listbox is closed.
- Clicking outside the component closes the listbox.
- The trigger contains a small triangle icon pointing downward to indicate there are options.
