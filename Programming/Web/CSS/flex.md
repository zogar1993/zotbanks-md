### Flex children

```css
/* how much the content will grow to accommodate white space, defaults to 0 */ 
flex-grow: 1;

/* how much the content will shrink when not enough space, defaults to 1 */ 
flex-shrink: 0;

/* the component is the size of its content, unless flex basis is set, which overrides the base size used before shrink and grow calculations */ 
flex-basis: 0;
```
