## Tips for spacing

Symmetrical padding for x and y is not good when related to text. Optical spacing is better, as y padding must sometimes be lower in order to compensate for empty space of font.

Relationship strength should determine how close elements are. The stronger the relationship, the closer the elements.

A recommendation is to have 6 levels of distance depending on relationship strength, exponential among themselves. Lower levels can be skipped, but its not recommended to skip higher ones.
