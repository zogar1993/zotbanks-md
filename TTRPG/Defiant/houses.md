## Angels

### House Aratron

**Angels of Mercy**

*There can be no mercy without atonement*

- A higher purpose is needed
- The conscience of Defiant society, supporting those in need, righting wrongs, and mending the souls of those who struggle.
- Not only do people need to right their wrongs, they need to endure suffering to forgive themselves.
- Forgiveness must me sought.
- Caring, loving, ruthless, cruel.
- Royals have an Aratronite confessor that needs to be present when they pray to the Sephira, and they choose the appropriate penance.
- To change the confessor, a matriarch or patriarch needs to approve the position, and that is not an easily granted request.
