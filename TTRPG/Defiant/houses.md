## Angels

### House Aratron

**Angels of Mercy**

*There can be no mercy without atonement*

- A higher purpose is needed
- The conscience of Defiant society, supporting those in need, righting wrongs, and mending the souls of those who struggle.
- Not only do people need to right their wrongs, they need to endure suffering to forgive themselves.
- Forgiveness must me sought.
- Caring, loving, ruthless, cruel.
- Royals have an Aratronite confessor that needs to be present when they pray to the Sephira, and they choose the appropriate penance.
- To change the confessor, a matriarch or patriarch needs to approve the position, and that is not an easily granted request.

## Leviathans

**Storm Leviathans**

*The weaker shall bow to your desires*

- Terrible at compromises and cannot stand half measures.
- The right of the strong is to take from the weak.
- Others are to be used and satiate their leaders hungers.
- To earn respect one must show their strength.
- The least prejudiced against other origins, and do not hold members of their bloodline in higher esteem than others. Power knows no origin or house.
- Deep in their hearts, they are still mighty beasts         of prey.

#### Show of strength

Hadad Lords need to probe they are worthy of their status, showing dominance over their courts. Their holding and subjects should be mold to suit their tastes and desires.
