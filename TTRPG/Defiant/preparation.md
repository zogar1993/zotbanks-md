## Secrets

- Every NPC should have at least a secret.
- When their secret is discovered, create them another one. Try to use a different kind of secret his time.

### Dirty
- Obvious weakness.
- Has done or is doing something wrong.
- Can be a minor transgression or something serious.
- Can be against defiant rules or against someone personally.

### Surprising
- Turns the story of an NPC in a new direction.
- Do not overuse, since too many may cause disinterest.

### Silly
- Makes them feel more human and relatable.
- Deepens the relationship with the NPC.
- Don't overdo it, unless intentionally wanting them to fell wacky.

### Dark
- Like dirty, but cannot be used as blackmail.
- Not benign, but usually a thing of the past or technically not illegal.
- Either builds the NPC, makes it be perceived as a threat, or is something they are ashamed of.

### Intimate
- Mostly benign.
- Not told to many (or any).
- When learned, you should either feel allowed into their private world or in a breach of personal boundaries.
