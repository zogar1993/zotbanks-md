## Declaration

Actions that do not need a challenge.

## Challenges
Actions that pose some kind of risk, reward, or penalty. Challenges require the player to stablish what he aims to achieve, more so that what he wants to do.

- Roll 3 dice. 5 or more in the die is success.
- For each potential, grow your smaller die (from d6 to d8, from d8 to d10).
- If all dice are d10, each extra potential adds 1 to your lowest roll.
- If all dice are d6 and you have negative potential, each negative potential subtracts 1 from the highest die roll.
- If at least a 1 is rolled, add a mark to trouble.
- For each thing that you want to achieve apart from the first, lower your potential by one.
- You can use afflictions as an advantage when calculating potential (even if it is also being used as a disadvantage), but add two marks to trouble if you roll a 1.
- Can spend a shard to add a d8 to the roll and ignore 1s in the roll, so you never mark trouble when spending a shard.
- When using a courtier, you add their appropriate traits to your potential. They get an affliction afterwards. They can’t be used while they have an affliction. (is it a minor affliction?)
- When using your spouse, you add their appropriate traits to your potential. You get an affliction afterwards instead of your spouse.
- Another PC can aid if he has at least 1 appropriate trait. In case of failure, every helper gets a negative modifier (meaning afflictions?). (adds 1 or adds potential?).
- PVP Challenges subtract the victims traits. In case of success, the victim can choose to ignore effects if it was a social challenge, instead taking an affliction of severity equal to successes.
- In PVP Challenges, the victim can spend a shard to cancel the opponent's shard bonus.
- Challenges are never exactly what you wanted, they are always more (>=3) or less (<=2).

### Challenge Outcomes

#### 0
- At the mercy of the GM, most likely fails. Could have even succeeded, but he will wish he hadn’t.
- Never make the character look weak stupid or pitiful.
- MAY mark severe affliction or distribute 3 setbacks on endeavor tracks.

#### 1
- Barely achieve the goal, but probably not worth it.
- Heavy price, tough choice to make, or got a little less than what they wanted.
- MAY mark a major affliction or distribute 2 setbacks.

#### 2
- Almost perfect outcome, except for a small detail
- MAY mark a minor affliction or a single setback.

#### 3
- Excellent and got something more from the situation.
- MAY progress 1 of your endeavors by one.

#### 4
- Impressive
- Something remarkable won in your favor.
- MAY grant 1 or 2 steps to distribute among endeavors.

### Challenge Outcome Options
Usually challenges have one of the following options.
- The Price: You paid a price for success (Perhaps someone saw you do something you shouldn’t).
- The choice: You have a choice to make, like one more modest and one where you gain more at a cost.
- The condition: You know something bad will happen if you go through, but you can choose whether to follow or not.

### Impossible challenges
- Can be withdrawn.
- Can need additional requirements.
- May suggest an alternative challenge.
- Can be turned into setting up an Endeavor.

## Endeavors

Actions that cannot be completed in a single scene. They are composed mainly of a series of challenges spaced in time in order to further your agenda.

- Starts when a character states the endeavor or when he does the first action towards initiating it.
- The Goal needs to be clear and understood by all players at the table.
- They don't usually end in the same episode they are created in.
- Progress is marked with a /.
- Challenges to advance endeavor advance by 1 if at least 1 success is earned.
- Can only take one challenge per scene to advance endeavors, meaning you can only advance one endeavor per scene this way.
- Unrelated challenges with 3 successes MAY advance an endeavor (there is no limit to how many times this may happen, altho it's up to GM if it happens at all).
- Standing can be used to forward Endeavors 1 by Standing point, cashing in favors with Princeps or House.
- They can advance through Personal Challenges.
- Characters can help or sabotage other players' endeavors. They work the same as they would for advancing their own, although it marks Setback in case of sabotage. This counts as an Endeavor Challenge though, so you will not be able to advance your own Endeavor in that scene.

### Endeavors Length
- 3: Simple, a little more complex than a challenge
- 6: Complex and requires many steps
- 9: Complicated master plan
- At a royals expense +1
- At expense of more than 1 royal, or higher than a royal, +3
- Strengthens commandment or local rule -2
- Against commandment, principle or province rule, +1/+3
- Minimum 3

### Endeavors first Challenge
- If at least 1 success, mark 1 box.
- The successes represent the severity of the condition for fulfilling the endeavor.
- 0: The condition is so severe it may not be worth pursuing
- 1: A condition that may need a challenge to complete
- 2: A formality
- 3: Minor condition and extra reward
(can use shard?)

### Finishing an Endeavor
- Once you complete the condition, you can make a challenge to finish the endeavor, which will state how it all turned out.
- You can rush an Endeavor by finishing it before completing its boxes. Every unchecked box lowers potential for the challenge.

### Setbacks
- Every episode all endeavors mark a Setback by converting an / into an x.
- Setbacks can also be marked by scoring a challenge with less than 3 successes, at GM discretion. The challenge needs not be one to advance the endeavor.
- When a Setback is to be marked but no marked boxes are left, you either abandon the Endeavor and nothing happens, or convert all x into / but activate a Trouble. This does not reset the Trouble track.

## Standing

Standing can be Province Standing o House Standing.

- Any can be used to help with endeavors, each standing spent, is a box ticked in an endeavor. They represent influences being used and favors being called.
- Province standing can also be used to ask an audience with the Princeps, even if they don't like you. They will act cordial and at least give some thought to your plea, although there is no obligation for more than that.
- House standing lets you ask for the help of a house member anytime there is one, although they wont do anything illegal or against house values (gray areas are debatable). Someone that dislikes you will help you, but there may be later repercussions.

### Gaining Standing

At the end of every Episode ask, have…
- you done right by your province and princeps? (Province Standing)
- you stayed true to your bloodlines creed and ideas? (House Standing)
- you fulfilled your royal duties to the full extent? (Any Standing)
- you done anything notable to support principles or commandments? (Any Standing)
- your actions gained popularity and fame throughout the domain? (Any Standing)

## Afflictions

Characters gain minor, major and severe afflictions, although they can never have more than 3 of each. If they get a fourth of one, they convert one into a more severe version of it.

- Minor afflictions lower potential by 1
- Mayor afflictions lower potential by 2
- Severe afflictions lower potential by 3

Afflictions may come from challenges, though not necessary:
- 2 successes: minor affliction
- 1 success: major affliction
- 0 successes: severe affliction.

A declaration may incur affliction, although the character must know so before taking the action.

You may get rid of afflictions by appropriate conduct:
- Minor afflictions need a declaration and a small description of how they get rid of it.
- Mayor afflictions usually require outside help or an item.
- Severe need be the primary focus of a scene to get rid.

After the Episode you may remove 1 minor affliction and reduce one of any category into 1 lesser (it is possible to remove 2 minor this way).
