# Player Motivations

Most players enjoy many aspects of the game at different times. For convenience, we define the primary
player motivations as types of players: actors, explorers, instigators, power gamers, slayers, storytellers,
thinkers, and watchers.

## Actor

The actor likes to pretend to be her character. She
emphasizes character development that has nothing to
do with numbers and powers, trying to make her character seem to be a real person in the fantasy world. She
enjoys interacting with the rest of the group, with characters and monsters in the game world, and with the
fantasy world in general by speaking “in character” and
describing her character’s actions in the first person.
The actor values narrative game elements over
mechanical ones. Unlike the storyteller, she values
her character’s personality and motivations over other
story elements.

### AN ACTOR...
- Provides PC background, emphasizing personality.
- Plays according to her character’s motivations.
- Prefers scenes where she can portray her character.
- Often prefers social encounters to fights.
- 
### ENGAGE THE ACTOR BY...
- Facilitating her PC’s personality and background
development.
- Providing roleplaying encounters.
- Emphasizing her character’s personality at times.
- Recruiting her to help create narrative campaign elements.

### BE SURE THAT THE ACTOR DOESN’T...
- Bore the other players by talking to everyone and
everything.
- Justify disruptive actions as being “in character.”

## Explorer
An explorer loves to see new places in the fantasy
world and to meet the residents of such places, fair and
foul. All the explorer needs is the promise of an interesting locale or different culture, and off he goes to see
that place.
The explorer wants to experience the wonders the
game world has to offer. He also wants to know that
there’s more out there to find. He presses for details:
proper names of characters and places, descriptions
of the environment, and some idea of what’s over the
next hill. He’s sometimes interested in the adventure
plot and his character’s motivations. (The explorer is
close kin to both the actor and the storyteller.) The
wonder of new discoveries is what is key to keeping the
explorer happy.

### AN EXPLORER...
- Seeks out new experiences in the game’s setting.
- Likes learning hidden facts and locating lost items and
places.
- Enjoys atmosphere as much as combat and story.
- Advances the plot by being willing to move ever on.

### ENGAGE THE EXPLORER BY...
- Including encounter elements that call for exploration.
- Rewarding curiosity and willingness to explore.
- Providing rich descriptions, and using cool maps and props.
- Recruiting him to map for the party.

### BE SURE THAT THE EXPLORER DOESN’T...
- Use knowledge of the game world to his own advantage.
- Bore the other players or exhaust you with his thirst for
detail.

## Instigator
An instigator enjoys making things happen. She has
no patience for careful planning or deliberation. She’ll
open an obviously trapped chest “just to see what
happens.” She provokes authority figures and opens
dungeon doors to bring more monsters into an already
difficult fight. The instigator loves the vicarious thrill
of taking enormous risks and sometimes just making
bad choices.
The instigator can be disruptive, but she can also be
a lot of fun for the other players. Things rarely grind to
a halt with an instigator in the group, and the stories
that get retold after the game session often revolve
around whatever crazy thing the instigator did this
week.

### AN INSTIGATOR...
- Likes to make things happen.
- Takes crazy risks and makes deliberately bad choices.
- Thrives in combat and dislikes having nothing to do.
- Takes decisive action when things grind to a halt.

### ENGAGE THE INSTIGATOR BY...
- Including objects and encounters that invite
experimentation
- Letting her actions put the characters in a tight spot but not
kill them all.
- Including encounters with nonplayer characters who are as
feisty as she is.

### BE SURE THAT THE INSTIGATOR DOESN’T...
- Get the rest of the group killed.
- Attack the other PCs or their allies.

## Power Gamer
A power gamer thrives on gaining levels and loves the
cool abilities that come with those levels. He defeats
monsters to take their stuff and use that stuff against
future enemies. The story and roleplaying are secondary to action and awesome abilities and magic items.
Most players have a little power gamer in them. A
couple of the core elements of fun in the D&D game
are the accumulation of power and the use of that
power to accomplish astonishing deeds. Nothing is
wrong with enjoying that in the game.

### A POWER GAMER...
- Optimizes character attributes for combat performance.
- Pores over supplements for better character options.
- Spends less time on story and roleplaying elements.
- Prefers combat to other kinds of encounters.

### ENGAGE THE POWER GAMER BY...
- Stressing story element rewards, such as quest XP.
- Using a desired magic item as an adventure hook.
- Facilitating access to new options and powers.
- Including encounters that emphasize his PC’s attributes.

### BE SURE THAT THE POWER GAMER DOESN’T...
- Become a lot more powerful than the other characters.
- Try to take more than his share of treasure.
- Treat the other characters as his lackeys.

## Slayer
The slayer is like the power gamer, but she is even
easier to please. She emphasizes kicking the tar out of
monsters. Maybe she does so to let off a little steam in
a safe way, or she likes the joy of feeling superior. Perhaps it’s the pleasure of having the power to mete out
punishment to villains.
D&D combat is thrilling. Few other aspects of
the game put a character in such apparent jeopardy.
Beating the bad guys is a clear success. Most players
enjoy these D&D elements, but the slayer seeks them
foremost.

### A SLAYER...
- Optimizes like a power gamer.
- Might pick simple options to get into the action quicker.
- Spends less time on story and roleplaying elements.
- Wants to fight monsters and take bold action all the time.

### ENGAGE THE SLAYER BY...
- Springing an unexpected battle when the slayer looks
bored.
- Making some battles simple and others more complex.
- Vividly describing the havoc the slayer wreaks with powers.
- Recruiting her to track initiative during combat.

### BE SURE THAT THE SLAYER DOESN’T...
- Ruin adventures by killing monsters the characters should
talk to.
- Rush past social and skill challenge encounters to the next
fight.

## Storyteller
The storyteller is a player who prefers the narrative
of the game to individual character motivations and
personality. This player sees the game as an ongoing
chronicle of events in the fantasy world, and he wants
to see where the tale goes.
For the storyteller, the rules are there to support the
game’s ongoing story. He believes that when the rules
get in the way, the narrative should win. Compromise
for the sake of the story is more important than individual character motivations.

### A STORYTELLER...
- Often provides an extensive background for his PC.
- Works hard to make sure his character fits the story.
- Likes dramatic scenes and recurring characters.
- Prefers adventures that include at least some plot.

### ENGAGE THE STORYTELLER BY...
- Facilitating his PCs background development.
- Using his background to help define adventures and
nonplayer characters.
- Including at least a little plot in every adventure.
- Recruiting him to record important events and encounters.

### BE SURE THAT THE STORYTELLER DOESN’T...
- Insist on making his character the center of the story.
- Dictate other characters’ actions to fit his idea of the story.

## Thinker
A thinker likes to make careful choices, reflecting on
challenges and the best way to overcome them. She
also enjoys herself most when her planning results in
success with minimal risk and use of resources.
Solving a challenge in a creative way is more important to the thinker than character power or roleplaying
issues. In fact, the thinker might prefer sound tactics
to acting in character or straightforward, brute force
battle.

### A THINKER...
- Engages any challenge as a puzzle to be solved.
- Chooses her actions carefully for the best possible result.
- Is happy to win without action, drama, or tension.
- Prefers time to consider options over bold action.

### ENGAGE THE THINKER BY...
- Including encounters that require problem-solving skills.
- Rewarding planning and tactics with in-game benefits.
- Occasionally allowing a smart plan to cause a one-sided
win.
- Recruiting her to help come up with quests.

### BE SURE THAT THE THINKER DOESN’T...
- Constantly tell the other players what to do.
- Grind the game to a halt when considering tactical options.

## Watcher
A watcher is a casual player who comes to the game
because he wants to be part of the social event. A
watcher might be shy or just really laid back. He wants
to participate, but he doesn’t really care if he’s deeply
immersed, and he doesn’t want to be assertive or too
involved in the details of the game, rules, or story. He
enjoys the game by being part of a social circle.

### A WATCHER...
- Shows up to be a part of the group.
- Helps calm disputes by not being as attached to the game.
- Often fills a hole in the PC group, facilitating the fun.

### ENGAGE THE WATCHER BY...
- Never forcing him to be more involved than he wants.
- Accepting that he’s fine with his watcher status.
- Prompting him when he needs it.

### BE SURE THAT THE WATCHER DOESN’T...
- Distract the other players with TV, a video game, or surfing
the Internet.
- Disappear from the table at crucial moments.
