## 1. Big Picture

Establish a broad idea of what the story is about. Something like "Mankind leaves sick earth behind and spread out to the stars" is good. Its not bad to stablish a tone and setting here also, like "its a war story" or "its a political scheming story" or "technology is steampunk".

This is done as a group decision. Everybody should want to play the type of story you are telling, so its important you are on the same page.

## 2. Bookend History

Create a **Starting Period** and an **Ending Period**. Everything you play later will be included between these 2 boundaries.

As with any period:
- describe what th period is about.
- use the card vertically.
- write a short description in the card.
- set the tone for each, light or dark, in the card.
- Mark them as (start) and hover (end).

This is done as a group decision.

## 3. Palette - Add or Ban Ingredients

- Create a **Yes** list and a **No** list.
- On the yes list, add things you want to be on the story, but are not obvious to the setting.
- On the no list, add things you don't want to be on the story, but one could expect from the setting.
- Everyone adds something to the yes list, the no list, or nothing. It does not need to be in order or turns, but you can just add one thing.
- If everybody added one thing, another round is done, indefinitely.
- If someone decided not to add something, then this step is over when everybody has made their choice this round.
- These are negotiable group decisions, maybe someone wants to ban "aliens", and some other player wants them included, so they reach a compromise, banning "communication with aliens".

## 4. First pass

- Each player adds **Period** or an **Event**.
- Players can go in any other they want.
- Periods and events need to have tone: light or dark.
