## Periods

A Period is the largest subdivision of the history. It is a very large chunk of 
time, usually decades or centuries depending on your history, like an era of 
feudal wars or stellar colonization.

 1) **Decide when it is**: Place the new Period between any two 
adjacent Periods.
 2) **Describe the Period**: Give the other players a grand  summary of what happens during this time or what things are like. Describe how it is different from other Periods around it, as appropriate.
 3) **Say whether it is Light or Dark**: Explain how that Tone fits your description. You’re never wrong about Tone, but you do have to justify your choice to the other players.



 Your description can include how the new Period relates to the Periods around it. But even if you visualize your Period as coming right before or after another Period, someone else could add a Period in between them later on, so long as their description of their Period doesn’t contradict what was already said.

 Note that you don’t specify exactly how long a Period is. Your description may include a broad sense of how much time is passing (“it’s a war that rages for generations” or “this is decades after the revolution”), but we never count years or worry about exactly how long something is.

### Writing the card
 Write your Period description on an index card, oriented tall, with an empty or filled circle to show Light or Dark respectively. You don’t have to write the whole description, just a short note to define the Period. Put your card where you indicated it goes in the history.

### Sample Description
*“This is before the colonies build the warp-net, but they 
have developed faster star drives, so you can travel between 
worlds in a few weeks rather than years. Interstellar 
commerce and travel is now commonplace. The New Sun 
faith from the ‘Crusades’ Period is everywhere, but it’s 
not a fervent belief anymore, just customs and traditions 
everyone shares without thinking about it.”*

## Events

## Scenes

### 1. State question

- The question is asked by the *scene creator*.
- The question can stablish facts.
- The scene proceeds until the question is answered.
- The scene finishes as soon as the question is answered.

### 2. Set stage

- When does the scene happen? Inside of which events, and between which scenes.
- Review established facts, what things do we already know that relate to the scene.
- Where? Why? What just happened or what happens next?

### 3. Choose characters

#### Require and band characters
- The *scene creator* requires up to two characters.
- The *scene creator* requires up to two characters.
- Bans can be individuals or groups, but you can't ban a group for what its not, since that would make the group a requirement for everyone.

#### Picking characters
- Each player picks a character, starting from the player right to the *scene creator* and continuing to the right.
- The character can be created on the spot.
- The character can create relationships with other characters and the world.
- Last players are forced to pick the mandatory characters if they have not already been picked.

### 4. Reveal thoughts
- Each player states thoughts about the upcoming scene, starting from the player right to the *scene creator* and continuing to the right.
- Thoughts could be what you plan to do or what you expect.
- Do not answer the question with the thought. You can hint tho.
- You can think about other characters, but its just what your character thinks. The other character has the final say wether that is true.
- After everyone has chosen, the *scene creator*can choose to say who else are present, but everybody can have new people enter the scene whenever they want once they start playing the scene.
