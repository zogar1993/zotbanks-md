## Experience

Personal experience points for each character.

### Earning Experience

The Gamemaster asks your character questions, and for every one that you can answer with a “yes” you are granted 1 XP.

1. Did you participate in the session?
(The character always gets at least 1 XP)
2. Did you confront any vaesen?
3. Did you identify a previously unknown
vaesen?
4. Were you affected by your Dark Secret?
5. Did you take risks to protect other people?
6. Have you learned anything? (what?)

You can spend 5 xp to buy an Advance, and choose from:
