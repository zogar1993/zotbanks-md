## Advantage

On the way to a mystery you will be able to gain an  Advantage, but only one per mystery. The Advantage  might be a new acquaintance who will then be available  at the location to help you, a mysterious experience  that gives you power, or you maintaining or training  with your weapons on the way to the location. The  Advantage can also be you bonding with another player  character, which will later help you work together.

You can use your Advantage once per gaming session, which adds +2 dice to a skill test. You must  decide whether to use it before rolling the dice, or when pushing the roll (see chapter 3), and explain  how you use it. After the mystery your Advantage  is lost. Next time you must choose another skill as  your Advantage.
